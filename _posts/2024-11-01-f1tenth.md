Last week, we competed in the 3rd F1tenth Korea Championship and brought home the 7th prize! We competed against 36 teams from different universities across Asia. 🙌

Through this challenge, we made a prototype of F1 racing car hardware 1/10 of its size, and developed agile navigation stacks using ROS 2 that can navigate in a challenging dynamics of high speed car and avoid dynamic obstacles.

This wouldn’t have been possible without our amazing team, consisting of grad students from LiCS of AE KAIST. A big shoutout to Chala Adane, Minjo Jung, and Byeongmin Jeong! ✈️

I’m still in the early stages of my research journey on learning-based agile robots, but I’m excited to see where this takes us. I can’t wait to take on the next challenge and continue my research in this exciting field.
